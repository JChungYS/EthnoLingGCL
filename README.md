Abstract
Topic: Proposal of comparative ethnolingual studies of the linguists’ communities in the
Hong Kong (LSHK), Greater China and beyond

Title: Proposed Open Source Ethnolingual studies of LSHK and beyond

The purpose of this research is to maximize the open-source collaboration research outcome through ethnolingual understanding of and through the linguists' communities with the scalability of the scope in the context of Hong Kong as a hub connecting Greater China (GC) with the global communities.

The language and cultural barriers between the linguists in different GC regions and the global communities obstruct the development of collaborative research and interaction for academic research.  The linguists in GC research focus in major languages and seldom go beyond minority languages of their regional/national boundary, despite of the technology of global connection and global language technology in general. The linguists need more reflection, besides academic values, about their social responsibility with relevance to the grassroots. Different institutes have a different degree of tension of proprietary data/research for sustainability and open source/sharing resource collaboration mentality for the common good. The multilingual/cultural linguist LSHK may not aware of their potential to push their limit of contribution in more collaborative and strategic researches to resolve the issues for the welfare of the world.

Approaches:

Data of linguists and their researches in the public domain will be collected and analyzed with python data science  (machine learning) tool along with participant observation in a research/post-graduate program and/or in different events and conferences of the linguist’s communities in the greater China, with a focus on Hong Kong, then mainland. The write up will be published at least in Chinese and English languages with Open Source license. This will allow flexibility and scalability of different scopes with the potential extension to other disciplines and multidiscipline contexts depending on the resources and outcomes, and financial model. This project is open for collaboration with research/developer/funding partners

The project will result in interactions and collaborations between linguists’ communities within and beyond the LSHK.  The interactions and collaborations will be documented as an ongoing open-source project to shift the academic research to more relevance and extend the scope of the world’s languages beyond the greater China. This pilot project would inspire more cost-effective Chinese/HK linguistic open sources project and resources available to academic communities and the general public.  
In conclusion the multilingual/multicultural linguists’ communities and open source communities in HK can contribute in a unique way to connect the Greater China with global academic communities and general public.
